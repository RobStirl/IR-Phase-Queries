# Two-Word Phase Queries

First, a Boolean Incidence Matrix and an Inverted Index will be created from a large collection of text documents in a given directory.
Then, given a two-word phrase query, four lists will be outputted to the user:
1: Documents that contain the two word phase (the two words appearing next to each other).
2: Documents the contain both words but not in order (not as a phrase).
3: Documents that contain the first but not the second word.
4: Documents that contain the second but not the first word.
